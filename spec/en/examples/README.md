## Example GTFS-ride Fileset

Examples of GTFS-ride filesets are provided to aid users in understanding structure and troubleshooting GTFS-ride. Two examples are available: a ["simple" example](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride/blob/master/spec/en/examples/ride_sample_simple.zip) that uses near-minimum inputs in all the GTFS-ride files and an ["all" example](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride/blob/master/spec/en/examples/ride_sample_all.zip) that uses each attribute in GTFS-ride at least once. The files constituting the examples may be found in this directory separated by [GTFS files](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride/tree/master/spec/en/examples/gtfs-sample) and [GTFS-ride files](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride/tree/master/spec/en/examples/ride-specific).
